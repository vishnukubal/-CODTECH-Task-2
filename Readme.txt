Project Overview: Network and Web Application Security Scanner
Objective

The goal of this project is to provide a tool for scanning network and web application security. It helps identify open ports, check for outdated software versions, 
and detect potential misconfigurations on a target system.

Components

    Port Scanning
        Purpose: To identify open ports on a target IP address. Open ports can potentially be exploited if they are associated with vulnerable services.
        Implementation: Uses multi-threading to efficiently scan a range of ports from start_port to end_port. Each port is checked to see if it’s open and accessible.

    Outdated Software Check
        Purpose: To identify if the web server software running on a target URL is outdated. Outdated software versions can be vulnerable to known exploits.
        Implementation: Requests the URL and inspects the Server HTTP header to determine the software version. Compares the version against known vulnerable versions to determine if it is outdated.

    Misconfiguration Check
        Purpose: To detect potential security misconfigurations in the web application. Misconfigurations can expose sensitive information or provide unauthorized access.
        Implementation: Requests the URL and performs basic checks, such as looking for directory listings in the response. Additional checks can be added to detect other types of misconfigurations.

Technical Details

    Port Scanning
        Uses the socket library to attempt connections to each port.
        Employs threading to speed up the scanning process by scanning multiple ports simultaneously.

    Outdated Software Check
        Uses the requests library to fetch HTTP headers from the target URL.
        Parses the Server header to extract and evaluate the software version.

    Misconfiguration Check
        Uses the requests library to fetch the content from the target URL.
        Looks for specific indicators of misconfiguration in the response content.

How It Works

    Input: The user provides the target IP address and website URL.
    Port Scanning: The tool scans the specified range of ports on the IP address to identify open ports.
    Software Check: The tool checks the web server software version and determines if it’s outdated.
    Misconfiguration Check: The tool examines the web application for common misconfigurations.
    Output: Displays the results of the port scan, outdated software, and misconfiguration checks.

Use Cases

    Security Auditors: To assess the security posture of a network and web applications.
    System Administrators: To identify potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in their own systems.
    Penetration Testers: To gather information about a target system as part of a security assessment.
